# edge-graphql
One Graph Service with graphql federation v2 example.
We're using [Apollo Federation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/) which is an open source architecture for building a distributed graph.
With Apollo Federation, we're able to implement GraphQL in a microservice architecture. Itâ€™s designed to replace schema stitching and solve pain points such as coordination, separation of concerns, and brittle gateway code.

## Sub Graphs
Edge GraphQL super graph is composed by the following sub graphs:

[Products Domain Graph Service](https://github.com/augustoscher/products-graphql-subgraph)

[Orders Domain Graph Service](https://github.com/augustoscher/orders-graphql-subgraph)



## Running

Make sure that all subgraphs are running.
To run the edge graphql, type:

```
yarn dev
```
or
```
make dev
```

## FAQ
- **How it works when subgraph schema changes in production? Supergraph needs to redeploy?**
...

- **What happens  when a subgraph is down?**
If any subgraph is down, the supergraph application will raise an error when it starts: `Error: Couldn't load service definitions for "orders" at http://localhost:4001/graphql: request to http://localhost:4001/graphql failed`.
When supergraph is already running and subgraph crashes for some reason, any request that it's handled by the crashed subgraph will fail.

- **Is it any performance issues?**
A note on performance: Query Planning and Execution adds a ~10ms overhead in the worst case. This includes the compute for building the query plan, as well as the deserialization of DGS responses and the serialization of merged gateway response.

- **How does it work with Relay subgraph?**
